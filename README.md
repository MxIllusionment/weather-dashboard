# weather-dashboard

## Description 
A web application for displaying the current weather and 5-day forecast for a given city. A search bar allows a city to be entered to find its weather. If the city is found, it is also added to a running history of previous searches. A history entry can then be clicked to bring up the weather for that city again.

It makes use of the Open Weather API as well as Bootstrap, jQuery, Moment.js, and Font Awesome.
